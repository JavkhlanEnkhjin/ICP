## Brief:

## Submission for ICP-2 from Team Mohamad/Jawa.
In IPC-2 submission, it includes main.py, input.txt, output.txt and readme.md files.
1. There are 2 solutions for question 1, nested and list comprehensions, customer_height() and 
customer_height1 respectively. Both functions take in the customer's weight in inches one at a time 
when the user specifies that they want to add a new height. Once all the heights are recieved they
will converted from inches to cm.
2. There are 2 functions for question 2, user_name() and string_alternative(). 
user_name() gets 2 input for full name from the user. string_alternative() takes as input the full user_name()
and prints every other char.
3. Question 3, get input.txt given in the ICP as input, reads it and then creates a list for all words. 
After that we created a dictionary that contains the occurance of each word as key and the count of each occurance
as value. Once iterating over the entire file is complete, we write the output to an output.txt file which contains
the total count of words found in the input file.
